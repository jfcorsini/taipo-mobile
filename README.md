# Taipo 

Taipo is a chat application that aims to help people to learn a new language. For more details on my motivation to build this, check my [blog post](https://jfcorsini.com/blog/chat-app-pt-1/).

This repository will keep track of the frontend development. To see how I am building the whole application, please check the following repositories:
  * ðŸ‘¾ Backend repository: [jfcorsini/taipo-frontend](https://github.com/jfcorsini/taipo-backend)
  * ðŸŽ¨ Frontend repository: [jfcorsini/taipo-frontend](https://github.com/jfcorsini/taipo-frontend)
  * ðŸ“± Mobile repository: [jfcorsini/taipo-mobile](https://github.com/jfcorsini/taipo-mobile)

## Development not started

Although the repository is here, work has not yet started. Once the frontend starts to look better, the work on the mobile application will start :)
